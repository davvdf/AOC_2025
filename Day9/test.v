//coordinates of tiles, must make biggest rectangle possible with 2 tiles as opposite corners
//start with convex hull then find largest 90 degree rectangle that includes 2 points as opposite corners
//approach might be sligthly different if since rotation of rectangle is constrained to 90 degrees and bigger rectangle might use inner points
